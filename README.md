# Magebit - Mid/Junior Web Developer Test

## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to first recreate a mobile and then desktop version of the site, fully responsive. Then add Javascript form validation and finally the PHP backend to handle form submission and MySQL to save data in a database.

I was given a mockup in Figma: [Magebit - Mid/Junior Web Developer Test](https://www.figma.com/file/p4jxR7jTYFqSaVewJTsHFj/Mid%2FJunior---Web-Developer-Test-%7C-Task-1?node-id=0%3A1)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### My approach

1) First analyzed and measured the design provided to me;
2) Structured html for parts of the page;
3) Began mobile first design layout and general layout;
4) Expanded responsive design from mobile, to tablet, to desktop;
5) Customized social media icons, checkbox, arrow/button and line divider; 
6) Added hover/active/focus effects/states;
7) Created subscription input validation in JS;
8) Designed the success message page;
9) Adjusted JS functionality for an email subscription;
10) Created a MySQL databas.

### What I learned

1) to commit to GitHub;
2) to translate a design from Figma to code; 
3) to choose free fonts alternative to paid ones;
4) to use <picture> for specifying image resources;
5) to create custom icons and to customize the checkbox;
6) to change the properties of svg images in normal state and on hover;
7) to turn an svg image into a submit button;
8) to make a website fully responsive using media queries;
9) to validate data in Javascript;
10) to create, display and remove error messages;
11) to create a MySQL database;
12) to use web dev tools;
13) to work with big amount of information and under time pressure;
14) to develop new learning habits and practices;
15) to prepare ReadMe file.
  
### Continued development

Though my current knowledge of backend technologies did not allow me to complete this part of the test, I gave it my best try and added some PHP files to the project to demonstrate my willingness to learn and the ability to acquire new skills. I will definitely continue to learn PHP and MySQL and plan to complete this part of the project for my own development on a later stage of my learning journey.
